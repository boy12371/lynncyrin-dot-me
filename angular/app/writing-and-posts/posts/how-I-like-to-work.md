### Product

Products I'm inspired to work on, prioritize:

- the experience of the user
- providing a great experience to all users, and continously expanding their user demographics
- engineering excellence, and a passion for using / creating the best tools for the job

### People

Teams I love working in, have:

- One or more engineers to pair with, skill share, or mentor
- A manager who sees their role as "guidance" rather than "driving"

### Engineering

Technical work I love doing, involves:

- Test driven development (TDD)
- Building out / hardening services within an existing system
- Rapid iteration on new small scale products / internal tools
- Creating developer infrastructure (CI/CD, automated tests, notification systems)
